# Grey

Grey is an anonymous-first social media web application designed to limit excessive usage and promote healthier online interaction. The platform removes identity-driven pressure and infinite engagement loops, allowing users to focus on expression and discussion rather than profiles, followers, or validation metrics.

## Overview

Modern social media platforms optimize for maximum engagement, often encouraging addictive behaviors and identity-based comparison. Grey takes a different approach by combining anonymity with intentional usage constraints to create a calmer, more thoughtful social experience.

Users can post and interact without revealing personal identity, while built-in limits reduce endless scrolling and encourage mindful participation.
